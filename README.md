## Features

- **Block Creation**: Implemented block structure with hash calculation and proof-of-work mechanism.
- **Blockchain Integrity**: Ability to validate the integrity of the blockchain.
- **Transactions**: Simple transaction system between participants.
- **Mining Rewards**: Incentivize mining by rewarding miners.
- **Serialization**: Blocks and transactions are serialized for potential network transmission.

---

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Rust**: A fast and safe systems programming language.
- **Cargo**: Rust's package manager and build system.
- **sha2**: Used for SHA-256 hashing functions.
- **Serde**: A framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures efficiently.

**Planned Technologies and Libraries:**

- **Actix Web**: For building a RESTful API to interact with the blockchain over HTTP.
- **Tokio**: An asynchronous runtime for handling concurrent network operations.
- **Persistent Storage**: Implementing a database (like RocksDB) to persist the blockchain data.

---

## Left to Do

- **Networking**: Enable peer-to-peer communication between nodes to distribute the blockchain.
- **Consensus Algorithm**: Implement a consensus mechanism like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).
- **Security Enhancements**: Add cryptographic signatures to transactions for improved security.
- **User Interface**: Develop a command-line interface (CLI) or web dashboard for easier interaction.
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Documentation**: Expand documentation for better developer understanding and contribution.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling throughout the application for robustness.
- **Smart Contracts**: Introduce a simple virtual machine to execute smart contracts.
- **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize the codebase for better performance.
